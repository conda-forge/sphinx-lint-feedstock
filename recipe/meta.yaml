  description: |
    Sphinx Lint is based on rstlint.py from CPython.
    It should be reasonably fast so it's comfortable to use as a linter in your editor,
    be usable on a single file,
    not give any false positives (probably a utopia, but let's try),
    not spend too much effort finding errors that sphinx-build already finds (or can easily find),
    and focus on finding errors that are not visible to sphinx-build.
